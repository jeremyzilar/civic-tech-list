# Civic-Tech list

## A listing of civic-tech organizations that are committed to human-centered design, cross-functional teams, working in the open, and making an impact on public services.

**Why does this list exist?**
As someone who works in the government, I get a lot of questions from people about how they can do more work for government or civic tech in general. Specifically, I needed one list to be able to forward on to people, and it needed to be in a place where others can contribute.
